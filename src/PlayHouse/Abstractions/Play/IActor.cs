///
/// Join Sequence (in JoinStageCmd):
/// 1. OnCreate() - Initialize actor state
/// 2. OnAuthenticate() - Authenticate the client (MUST set ActorLink.AccountId)
/// 3. OnPostAuthenticate() - Load user data from API server, etc.
///
/// Cleanup:
/// - OnDestroy() - Final cleanup when actor leaves stage
///
/// IMPORTANT: ActorLink.AccountId MUST be set during OnAuthenticate().
/// If it remains empty after authentication, the connection will be terminated.
